<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Have you ever had a night on your schedule where you had nothing to do, but you wanted to get out of the house? Meet the Anything Events Calendar! This application gives you access to a myriad of events happening around you, and the ability to filter by interests and location. Once you've found an activity you'll be able to add it to your own calendar and then it's all up to you!

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

There were several features that came up throughout the development of this project that we didn't have the resources/time to accomplish. Listed below are a few of the more compelling things we would like to add!

- Add a calendar aspect. Make it easy to integrate your selected options into a calendar.
- Keep users on our page. 
  - Instead of having the events link to another site, we want to add a modal to display information about the event on our site.
- Include pagination.
- Have a watch-list to keep in storage for possible future options.
