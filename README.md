## Usage
This is used for finding an art themed event around your area! Fill out your location and category you prefer, or try a random one! then a list of options will appear for you! Have fun!

## Roadmap
- Add a calendar aspect. Make it easy to integrate your selected options into a calendar.  
- Keep users on our page. Instead of having the events link to another site, we want to add a modal to display information about the event on our site.  
- Include pagination.  
- Have a watch-list to keep in storage for possible future options.
